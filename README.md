# Weather Prediction Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Weather Prediction" GitHub project. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for weather prediction through data analysis and machine learning. In this detailed README, we will introduce the project, delve into the codebase, explore the dataset, showcase project outputs, guide you on running the code, and provide licensing information.

## Introduction

Weather forecasting plays a pivotal role in our daily lives, influencing decisions from what to wear to more critical factors like planning outdoor events or agricultural activities. Our project harnesses the power of data-driven analysis and machine learning to make weather prediction more accessible and accurate.

## Codebase

The project's codebase is meticulously crafted in Python and leverages a diverse set of libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, folium, imageio, statsmodels, seaborn, TensorFlow, and Keras. The code is structured to encompass several crucial stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The initial step involves preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling. This includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is a fundamental aspect of our project, where we uncover insights from the data. It involves generating visualizations, calculating statistics, and understanding data distributions.

3. **Statistical Analysis**: We employ various statistical techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. This includes calculating probabilities, demonstrating the Central Limit Theorem, and exploring correlations between variables.

4. **Machine Learning Model**: The core of our project is the creation of a machine learning model for weather prediction. We utilize TensorFlow and Keras to develop a robust model capable of forecasting weather conditions accurately.

## Dataset

The cornerstone of our project is the "weather_dataset.csv" dataset, which comprises a diverse array of weather-related features. This dataset includes information on temperature, wind speed, rainfall, cloud thickness, and more. It serves as the foundation upon which our data-driven approach is built.

## Project Outputs

Here's a detailed preview of the project's outputs and visualizations:

### 1. Discrete Random Variable

We delve into discrete random variables, specifically focusing on cloud thickness. By calculating and visualizing probabilities, we gain valuable insights into cloud conditions.

### 2. Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem is demonstrated through the generation of a histogram, with a particular emphasis on rainfall probabilities. This section provides profound statistical insights into rainfall patterns.

### 3. Scatter Plot

To understand the relationship between wind speed at 3 pm and wind speed at 9 am, we employ a scatter plot. This graphical representation aids in deciphering wind patterns.
